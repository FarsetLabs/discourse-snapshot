</small><br>Yes, the beers can be drank from the box while the beers are in the box, as is tradition We’re Turning 10! Farset Labs was opened to the Belfast Maker Community in April 2012. Over the past decade, we’ve made a lot, broken a lot, grown a lot and learned… hopefully something. Come join us on Saturday the 9th of April for an afternoon and evening of making and celebration, kicking off with an Open ‘Maker Day’ from 1pm to 6pm, and the main celebration, which will kick off from 7pm, and will include drinks, refreshments, and memories. If you haven’t been back in Farset Labs for a while (particularly since the renovations…), this is the perfect re-introduction to Northern Ireland’s Makerspace. Also, if you’re a past or…</p>

            <p>We’ve got 175 books in 15 Pandora’s boxes: which ones do we keep and which do we give to charity? Choose our own adventure on Saturday 20th, 4-6pm.</p>
<p>Aiming for a speedy and good turnover with this: meaning lots of discussion, thinking caps on. Four to six tables; one box at a time. There will be tea. Every keep or lose decision to be peer-reviewed.</p>
<p>See something in the discard pile you want to take home? That’s a maybe. If a member wants to remove donation/s, it’s a good time to do so. No books will be moved from the space until early December. There may be pizza. If we don’t have bookcases by the 20th to hold the push, pull or design-based decisions, the volumes will be re-boxed, <strong>clearly labelled</strong>.</p>
<p>Bring your intellect.</p>

</small><br>Farset Labs has hosted Northern Ireland’s only public site of the international “Global Game Jam” hackathon for the past 8 years, and this year they’re bringing it back – again – virtually.  In the face of ‘unprecedented times‘, while the space, events facilities, co-working facilities and new-and-improved workshop (and Laser Cutter…) are still available to socially-distanced members, this year we can’t offer the usual warm, pizza and burrito fueled welcome we have over nearly the past decade to Northern Irelands Games Development community. So, as a have teamed up with our friends at the NI Game Dev Network to coordinate the Northern Ireland site of GGJ online due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Starting with a live-streamed kickoff event at 7pm on Friday 29th January, the jam will run…</p>

          <title>Workshop Defragmentation</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[caolanxyz]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Hack The Space</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>(TL;DR at the bottom)</p>
<p><strong>Background</strong></p>
<p>Between Farset’s expansion and closing due to COVID, we haven’t yet had a chance to properly organise the new workshop space. I’ve started some work on tidying the space but the  bulk of the work will be defragmenting and organising the parts/equipment. Ideally we’d be able to assemble a task force and take a day at it, but with social distancing this will have to be an asynchronous project. Slack (<a class="hashtag" href="https://discourse.farsetlabs.org.uk/tag/facilities">#<span>facilities</span></a>) is probably the easiest place for conversation, however to ensure clarity and posterity, I’d suggest that important discussion points and actions are recorded here on Discourse.</p>
<p>This project aims to ensure that:<br>
Outside of induction, anyone will be able to walk into the workshop and easily locate any parts/equipment they’re looking for.<br>
The workshop should be physically accessible to as many individuals as possible, particularly focussing on those with limited physical mobility (wheelchair users, etc)<br>
Health and Safety equipment is available, and made clearly visible and accessible to anyone in the workshop. Whilst all workshop users should be inducted, individuals should not have to complete induction to be able to locate vital safety equipment.</p>
<p>Additionally, this project will hopefully help us improve the usefulness of the space going forward whilst maintaining social distancing within the labs by allowing the event space to be used as an ‘overflow’ for the workshop.</p>
<p><strong>Social Distancing without reducing facilities</strong></p>
<p>A good place to start here is by (credit to <a class="mention" href="https://discourse.farsetlabs.org.uk/u/bolster">@bolster</a>) coming up with sensible ways to fill the new roller drawers with contextually relevant ‘packs’, either for workshops or particular activities. The idea being that rather than everyone being stuck in the workshop all the time, that they come in, grab a drawer, and move to the event space, reducing workshop occupancy and allowing more space for those performing activities that require the workshop itself (laser cutting, sawing, etc.). We’ve got one set of roller drawers so far that I’ve made a start on organising, however at this stage it’s mainly storing screws and spare parts, so any ideas for such ‘packs’ would be a great starting point.</p>
<p><strong>Accessibility</strong></p>
<p>At present, the workshop can be accessed by wheelchair users, however all the benches are too tall to be functional. My first suggestions for adjusting the space itself would be to replace the wooden bench along the back wall (where the glowforge is atm), and adding a similar bench along the right hand side (where the network cabinet is at present, once it’s wall mounted). I’d be more inclined to make the replacement glowforge bench wheelchair height to allow wheelchair users to easily access the glowforge itself, although my concern at the moment is that the adjacent shelves may make it difficult to get in/out.</p>
<p>As <a class="mention" href="https://discourse.farsetlabs.org.uk/u/bolster">@bolster</a> pointed out on slack, “the current questions aren’t so much ‘where do we want to be’ but ‘what can we do now’ and ‘what’s stopping this from being a useful resource at the moment’, i.e. getting people back in and using the place, which then re-cultivates the community, which then makes vision-setting a more inclusive process”, so I think the best immediate action would be to consult the membership on how they use the space at present and what changes can be made to make it more useful for them. Some will simply not be interested in using the workshop however it may only take a few simple changes and/or additions to make the space more functional for a lot more people.</p>
<p><strong>Access</strong></p>
<p>This has been in discussion for some time (since pre-expansion I think), but I believe the original plan was to limit access to the workshop to inducted users only using the maglock and keycards/an access code. I’m not sure this is a high priority right now, but it’s certainly something to discuss further once the workshop is fully operational.</p>
<p><strong>Equipment</strong></p>
<p>This is more of a personal wishlist than anything else, but I’d like to get ideas/opinions on what equipment would be useful to have in the workshop, and particularly what work it will enable for the membership. For me, I’ve primarily used the workshop for woodwork so far so I’d like an electric sander (or even better, a belt sander), and I’m interested in producing content both personally and for educational purposes, so I’d like to fit out the workshop with AV equipment to enable streaming/recording.</p>
<p>As I pointed out in <a class="hashtag" href="https://discourse.farsetlabs.org.uk/tag/facilities">#<span>facilities</span></a>, the workshop seems to have issues with insulation causing it to be quite cold, particularly in the evenings and especially now that we’re coming into the winter. It was pointed out that this is likely down to the seals on the escape door and around the extraction chute for the glowforge. Whilst I can personally compensate for the cold with more layers, this also factors into the accessibility point as it will make working in the workshop particularly difficult for those with sensory issues.</p>
<p>In terms of immediate purchases, I see an eye wash station as being essential. I think someone mentioned the possibility of plumping in a permanent solution, but for now I think we should invest in something like <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Hypaclens-Emergency-Sterile-Eyewash-Dressings/dp/B07GPVD6J3/ref=sr_1_6?crid=1NK997VVXM0YJ&amp;dchild=1&amp;keywords=eye+wash+station&amp;qid=1606611972&amp;sprefix=eye+wash+s%2Caps%2C175&amp;sr=8-6" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">this</a></p>
<p>Also more cans of compressed air. There can never be enough compressed air.</p>
<p><strong>Glowforge</strong></p>
<p>A suggestion was made previously in slack that it may be worth setting up a member’s glowforge account with a premium plan allowing members to access all the paid features of the glowforge without footing the bill for a subscription. Personally, I absolutely support the idea for 2 reasons: the glowforge design catalogue has a lot of (very nice) preset designs which will allow members to get started immediately, and I found the ability to create text and shapes directly on the glowforge app very helpful in reducing the barrier to entry. Most advanced users will likely still stick to custom vector designs, however I think the focus should be on making the equipment as accessible as possible and requiring members to get to grips with inkscape/illustrator as well as the glowforge itself adds a hefty additional hurdle to getting started.</p>
<p><strong>Power</strong></p>
<p>This was discussed at length on slack at the start of the year, but there seem to be issues with power quality in unit 1. I’ve noticed the lights in the workshop flickering often although I’m not sure if there was ever a conclusion.</p>
<p><strong>Immediate Changes</strong></p>
<p>As mentioned previously, I’ve made a start on tidying and organising the workshop to make it easier to work in in the short term. One improvement I’d like to make probably this week is wall-mounting one of the whiteboards sitting beside the boiler room. Any input on where it should go would be much appreciated. I know getting the vacuum cleaner from under the stairs isn’t a huge task, but I’d also propose moving it’s home to the boiler room to make it more accessible given the workshop will need hoovered more than the rest of the space. Also, whilst everyone should be aware of the induction process at this point, it wouldn’t do any harm to add a sign to the workshop door stating that members must be inducted to use the workshop.</p>
<p>As mentioned on slack, I’ve hooked up one of the unused optiplex machines (the former VPS machine) on the electronics bench with a Ubuntu Live USB - if there are no other plans for it, I’d suggest making it another windows machine (with inkscape etc pre-installed) similar to the 3D printer PC to allow members to work with the glowforge without a laptop.</p>
<p><strong>TL;DR</strong></p>
<p>This has been a fucked-up year at Farset so we haven’t had time to properly organise the workshop and it’s contents. Something of this scale won’t work by just going in and moving shit, so discussing and planning ahead of time is essential, and given social distancing requirements, this will have to be as asynchronous as possible. After all this is done, the workshop should be an accessible space where anyone can easily find equipment and parts, and have access to tools with minimised barrier to entry. Farset is by the members for the members, so please have a say in how the space can work better for you.</p>

          <title>Virtual Event: InfoSecNI Watch-Along Movie Night - “Johnny Mnemonic” @ 7pm 22nd July!</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[bolster]]></dc:creator>
          <category>InfoSecNI</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Based on William Gibson’s short story first published in 1981, the 1995 film by Robert Longo, follows the titular Johnny, a cybernetic data-courier, who is used to discreetly shuttle information in the real world that’s too sensitive for the VR based Internet of 2021. Seeking to regain his broken memories, Johnny undertakes ‘one more job’ to cover the costs of removal. After a risky procedure to give him more storage space, the clock is ticking for Johnny to get the data out of his head before the data in his brain kills him. The narrative incorporates themes that explore balance between superior technology against superior humanity. And Guns. Well, one gun.</p>
<p>And we’ll be watching it, this time a little later in the month.</p>
<p>As usual, this event will be a watch-along , so we’ll not be providing the media, but we’d encourage you to obtain it via rental and share the links in the discourse or otherwise and join in the discussion as we watch on Twitter using the <span class="hashtag">#InfoSecNI</span> hashtag or on our Discord, where we might even do a voice chat if we can deal with the sync issues…</p>

<p>I’ve been creating internet accounts since I was in early teens and some of them are still “active”.</p>
<p>Time to time I remember them and think about that password I reused a bunch of times in 2010 and never changed.</p>
<p>A chance to take some time and think about security of your online accounts and learn ways to protect yourself.</p>

            <p>Hello everyone! We’re going to be testing the waters and seeing if there’s interest out there for Security Certification Study Groups, and we’ll be pioneering this with a study group dedicated to the first few chapters of the CompTIA Security+ study guide on <em>Wednesday 22nd July at 6:30pm to 8pm (ish)</em>. We’ll be going through the chapters together and talking through difficult points, and doing the quizzes in the first 3 chapters of the book.</p>
<p><em>The study group will be held on our <a href="https://discord.gg/b8c3E9C" rel="nofollow noopener">Discord</a> server, make sure to join!</em></p>
<p>Don’t worry if you don’t have the study guide; come along anyway if you’re interested in this cert - the more the merrier!</p>
<p>We’ll be running additional study groups for other certs going forward too! Make sure to vote in the poll on our <a href="https://discord.gg/b8c3E9C" rel="nofollow noopener">Discord</a>, and make sure to vote here for the next study groups: <a href="https://discourse.farsetlabs.org.uk/t/which-security-certs-are-people-interested-in-taking/74" class="inline-onebox">Which Security Certs Are People Interested In Taking?</a></p>

            <p>Hello everyone! With the success and fun of our previous few community lockdown movie nights, we thought we’d host another one. This time, with a slightly more serious movie, we’ll be watching “Snowden”; the docu-drama about Edward Snowden, the famous whistleblower. This event will be a  <strong>watch-along</strong> , so we’ll not be providing the media, but we’d encourage you to obtain it via rental or otherwise and join in the discussion as we watch on Twitter, Discourse and Keybase.</p>
<p>Our Twitter is here if you’d like to give us a follow: <a href="https://twitter.com/infosecni" rel="nofollow noopener">https://twitter.com/infosecni </a></p>

<p><em>Feel free to make suggestions too, and we’ll add movies as they’re suggested!</em></p>

          <title>Virtual Infrastructure: Azurised CTFd and Juiceshop for infrastructure-free collaborative hackery</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[bolster]]></dc:creator>
          <category>InfoSecNI</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Last night, we had intended to do a ‘show and hack’, but we got distracted by infrastructure.</p>
<p><a href="https://discourse.farsetlabs.org.uk/t/virtual-meetup-juicing-the-juiceshop-6pm-20th-may/68">Virtual Meetup: Juicing the JuiceShop @ 6pm 20th May</a></p>
<p>So, instead, we used some spare Microsoft Azure credits that are donated to <a href="https://www.farsetlabs.org.uk">Farset Labs</a> and lo and behold;</p>
<ol>
<li>The Hackable JuiceShop:  <a href="https://infosecnijuiceshop.azurewebsites.net">https://infosecnijuiceshop.azurewebsites.net</a>
</li>
<li>The Shared Scoreboard: <a href="https://infosecnictfd.azurewebsites.net">https://infosecnictfd.azurewebsites.net</a>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Scoreboard you say? Why yes! Now, this is in no means a competition and there will be no prizes, but with a longer term persistent progress, we can all drop in and out when it suits, see what we did last, and solve a ‘challenge’ over lunch without having to spin up any core infrastructure.</p>
<p>So sign up to the scoreboard and start hacking the JuiceShop.</p>
<p>If you want to play along with your own infrastructure, the <code>CTF_KEY</code> is <code>infosecni_d34db33f</code>, and check out <a href="https://bkimminich.gitbooks.io/pwning-owasp-juice-shop/content/part1/ctf.html#overriding-the-ctfkey">here</a> for instructions for how to update your images so your CTF ‘Flags’ match those generated by the scoreboard.</p>
<p>Happy Hacking!</p>

            <p>After <a href="https://discourse.farsetlabs.org.uk/t/virtual-meetup-virtual-machine-crash-course/50/10">our first workshop session on secure VM operation</a>, InfoSecNI is back again!</p>
<p>We’re all going to get together and hack the most insecure web application imaginable; <a href="https://owasp.org/www-project-juice-shop/">Juice Shop</a>.</p>
<p>It’s recommended that before attending you get set up with a local VM infrastructure (i.e. One snapshotted instance of the Juice Shop on your local machine set up, see instructions <a href="https://pwning.owasp-juice.shop/part1/running.html">here</a>).</p>
<p>We would also recommend reading through the first Part of the <a href="https://pwning.owasp-juice.shop/part1/">JuiceShop Guide</a></p>
<p>The meetup is going to be a peer-learning, collaborative ‘hack’, where we can show off things we got to work, and ask questions about things that didn’t work, or how these attacks can be prevented (or automated).</p>
<p>We’re currently choosing between a couple of conference options to best facilitate the collaborative nature of the event, but watch this space and we’ll let you know!</p>

<p>It’d be really fun to start sharing ‘best practice’ on fixing these kinda things, with an eye to upstream data owners to</p>
<ol>
<li>recognise that people out here do want to help them</li>
<li>see that if they invest in making data easy to use, more people will be able to use it!</li>
</ol>
<p>I am shit at packaging and all the fancy automation stuff but I tried my best to make this pretty simple, and collaborators / PR’s / Issues / Ideas are <em>very</em> welcome, including but not limited to ‘This data is shit to work with, how would you tidy it up?’</p>

            <p>Hey everyone! It’s time to get together and watch Hackers! This topic will act as a place for movie discussion during the watch-along, and before and after it, too.</p>
<p>The movie can be rented from the following places:</p>

<p>Great workshop on particulate monitoring with ESP systems; minimal soldering required, but it’s missing two primary components (IMO);</p>
<p>Batteries and MQTT</p>
<p>From a ‘kitlist’, this could be part funded under the Open Data funding, meaning we could put on a subsidised workshop where people actually went away and installed their own sensors at home/work/whatever.</p>
<p>This thread is to keep track of progress/plans/ideas around this. And to shut slackbot up about reminding me to check in with <span class="mention">@glenn</span></p>
