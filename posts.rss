</small><br>Yes, the beers can be drank from the box while the beers are in the box, as is tradition We’re Turning 10! Farset Labs was opened to the Belfast Maker Community in April 2012. Over the past decade, we’ve made a lot, broken a lot, grown a lot and learned… hopefully something. Come join us on Saturday the 9th of April for an afternoon and evening of making and celebration, kicking off with an Open ‘Maker Day’ from 1pm to 6pm, and the main celebration, which will kick off from 7pm, and will include drinks, refreshments, and memories. If you haven’t been back in Farset Labs for a while (particularly since the renovations…), this is the perfect re-introduction to Northern Ireland’s Makerspace. Also, if you’re a past or…</p> ]]></description>

        <title>Hyper Book Club Hack [Sat 20th, 4-6pm]</title>

        <description><![CDATA[ <p>We’ve got 175 books in 15 Pandora’s boxes: which ones do we keep and which do we give to charity? Choose our own adventure on Saturday 20th, 4-6pm.</p>
<p>Aiming for a speedy and good turnover with this: meaning lots of discussion, thinking caps on. Four to six tables; one box at a time. There will be tea. Every keep or lose decision to be peer-reviewed.</p>
<p>See something in the discard pile you want to take home? That’s a maybe. If a member wants to remove donation/s, it’s a good time to do so. No books will be moved from the space until early December. There may be pizza. If we don’t have bookcases by the 20th to hold the push, pull or design-based decisions, the volumes will be re-boxed, <strong>clearly labelled</strong>.</p>
<p>Bring your intellect.</p>

</small><br>Farset Labs has hosted Northern Ireland’s only public site of the international “Global Game Jam” hackathon for the past 8 years, and this year they’re bringing it back – again – virtually.  In the face of ‘unprecedented times‘, while the space, events facilities, co-working facilities and new-and-improved workshop (and Laser Cutter…) are still available to socially-distanced members, this year we can’t offer the usual warm, pizza and burrito fueled welcome we have over nearly the past decade to Northern Irelands Games Development community. So, as a have teamed up with our friends at the NI Game Dev Network to coordinate the Northern Ireland site of GGJ online due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Starting with a live-streamed kickoff event at 7pm on Friday 29th January, the jam will run…</p> ]]></description>

<h1>Power</h1>
<p>We had some investigation into this earlier in the year, but I don’t know if we came to any conclusions or actionable accusations <a class="mention" href="https://discourse.farsetlabs.org.uk/u/richard">@Richard</a> ?</p>

</aside>
<p>Short answer no.  I’ve re-forwarded to you the single phase voltage data that was logged for Ground and First Floor.  However, my analysis would be that in terms of simple voltage trace there’s no actionable fault demonstrated.</p>
<p>However, based on the visible flicker from the light units, and the unbalanced total energy consumption on each of the three phases coming into the building on the distro cab on ground floor under stairs, I’d be pretty convinced something is screwed.  The other marginal possilbiility is that the LED lighting modules are substandard, however the unbalanced energy usage would perhaps point in a different direction.</p>
<p>It’s hard to know where any fault lies - it may well be completely outside the building, or may be related to the way loads have been unevenly applied across the 3 phase supply.</p>
<p>The simplest way forward - aside of hiring a specialist to undertake a survey and report - is probably to complain to NIE Networks via your electricty provider, and ideally get them to come and prove that it isn’t their upstream supply causing the issue.</p>
<p>Surveying other sites in Weavers Court for similar issues like flicker would also be useful intel.</p> ]]></description>

<p>Considering the work that <a class="mention" href="https://discourse.farsetlabs.org.uk/u/caolanxyz">@caolanxyz</a> has already put in to making the workshop usable, I think this all sounds great.</p>
<h1>Eye wash/first aid</h1>
<p>I’ve just ordered <a href="https://smile.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B01MYV5IMT/ref=ox_sc_act_title_1?smid=A3P5ROKL5A1OLE&amp;psc=1">these</a> to satisfy the first aid / eye wash requirement in the workshop.</p>
<h1>Glowforge Pro Account</h1>
<p>Biggest issue with getting a glowforge pro account is muli-user access and maintaining of custom material settings; if someone changes the material settings for a custom burn, that custom setting will be changed for other designs. Also, we’ll end up with design collisions etc. IMO, I don’t think there’s a good case for Pro at an organisation level because of these issues.</p>

<h1>Workshop Layout and Accessibility</h1>
<p>You’re actually right on the money that the initial plan was to build a seated-height workbench against the back wall, and that the wooden bench is effectively temporary.</p>
<p>IIRC the materials for the desk should be floating around, and mounting into the wall isn’t too difficult with the masonry drills we have.</p>
<p>But beyond that, I think we’d also need to look at a better storage solution for the middle / ‘inside’ of the workshop (i.e. where all the network equipment is). I got a set of shelves systems that can go up the next time we’re having a hack-the-space session.</p> ]]></description>

        <title>Workshop Defragmentation</title>
        <dc:creator><![CDATA[@caolanxyz Caolan McKendry]]></dc:creator>
        <description><![CDATA[ <p>(TL;DR at the bottom)</p>
<p><strong>Background</strong></p>
<p>Between Farset’s expansion and closing due to COVID, we haven’t yet had a chance to properly organise the new workshop space. I’ve started some work on tidying the space but the  bulk of the work will be defragmenting and organising the parts/equipment. Ideally we’d be able to assemble a task force and take a day at it, but with social distancing this will have to be an asynchronous project. Slack (<a class="hashtag" href="https://discourse.farsetlabs.org.uk/tag/facilities">#<span>facilities</span></a>) is probably the easiest place for conversation, however to ensure clarity and posterity, I’d suggest that important discussion points and actions are recorded here on Discourse.</p>
<p>This project aims to ensure that:<br>
Outside of induction, anyone will be able to walk into the workshop and easily locate any parts/equipment they’re looking for.<br>
The workshop should be physically accessible to as many individuals as possible, particularly focussing on those with limited physical mobility (wheelchair users, etc)<br>
Health and Safety equipment is available, and made clearly visible and accessible to anyone in the workshop. Whilst all workshop users should be inducted, individuals should not have to complete induction to be able to locate vital safety equipment.</p>
<p>Additionally, this project will hopefully help us improve the usefulness of the space going forward whilst maintaining social distancing within the labs by allowing the event space to be used as an ‘overflow’ for the workshop.</p>
<p><strong>Social Distancing without reducing facilities</strong></p>
<p>A good place to start here is by (credit to <a class="mention" href="https://discourse.farsetlabs.org.uk/u/bolster">@bolster</a>) coming up with sensible ways to fill the new roller drawers with contextually relevant ‘packs’, either for workshops or particular activities. The idea being that rather than everyone being stuck in the workshop all the time, that they come in, grab a drawer, and move to the event space, reducing workshop occupancy and allowing more space for those performing activities that require the workshop itself (laser cutting, sawing, etc.). We’ve got one set of roller drawers so far that I’ve made a start on organising, however at this stage it’s mainly storing screws and spare parts, so any ideas for such ‘packs’ would be a great starting point.</p>
<p><strong>Accessibility</strong></p>
<p>At present, the workshop can be accessed by wheelchair users, however all the benches are too tall to be functional. My first suggestions for adjusting the space itself would be to replace the wooden bench along the back wall (where the glowforge is atm), and adding a similar bench along the right hand side (where the network cabinet is at present, once it’s wall mounted). I’d be more inclined to make the replacement glowforge bench wheelchair height to allow wheelchair users to easily access the glowforge itself, although my concern at the moment is that the adjacent shelves may make it difficult to get in/out.</p>
<p>As <a class="mention" href="https://discourse.farsetlabs.org.uk/u/bolster">@bolster</a> pointed out on slack, “the current questions aren’t so much ‘where do we want to be’ but ‘what can we do now’ and ‘what’s stopping this from being a useful resource at the moment’, i.e. getting people back in and using the place, which then re-cultivates the community, which then makes vision-setting a more inclusive process”, so I think the best immediate action would be to consult the membership on how they use the space at present and what changes can be made to make it more useful for them. Some will simply not be interested in using the workshop however it may only take a few simple changes and/or additions to make the space more functional for a lot more people.</p>
<p><strong>Access</strong></p>
<p>This has been in discussion for some time (since pre-expansion I think), but I believe the original plan was to limit access to the workshop to inducted users only using the maglock and keycards/an access code. I’m not sure this is a high priority right now, but it’s certainly something to discuss further once the workshop is fully operational.</p>
<p><strong>Equipment</strong></p>
<p>This is more of a personal wishlist than anything else, but I’d like to get ideas/opinions on what equipment would be useful to have in the workshop, and particularly what work it will enable for the membership. For me, I’ve primarily used the workshop for woodwork so far so I’d like an electric sander (or even better, a belt sander), and I’m interested in producing content both personally and for educational purposes, so I’d like to fit out the workshop with AV equipment to enable streaming/recording.</p>
<p>As I pointed out in <a class="hashtag" href="https://discourse.farsetlabs.org.uk/tag/facilities">#<span>facilities</span></a>, the workshop seems to have issues with insulation causing it to be quite cold, particularly in the evenings and especially now that we’re coming into the winter. It was pointed out that this is likely down to the seals on the escape door and around the extraction chute for the glowforge. Whilst I can personally compensate for the cold with more layers, this also factors into the accessibility point as it will make working in the workshop particularly difficult for those with sensory issues.</p>
<p>In terms of immediate purchases, I see an eye wash station as being essential. I think someone mentioned the possibility of plumping in a permanent solution, but for now I think we should invest in something like <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Hypaclens-Emergency-Sterile-Eyewash-Dressings/dp/B07GPVD6J3/ref=sr_1_6?crid=1NK997VVXM0YJ&amp;dchild=1&amp;keywords=eye+wash+station&amp;qid=1606611972&amp;sprefix=eye+wash+s%2Caps%2C175&amp;sr=8-6" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">this</a></p>
<p>Also more cans of compressed air. There can never be enough compressed air.</p>
<p><strong>Glowforge</strong></p>
<p>A suggestion was made previously in slack that it may be worth setting up a member’s glowforge account with a premium plan allowing members to access all the paid features of the glowforge without footing the bill for a subscription. Personally, I absolutely support the idea for 2 reasons: the glowforge design catalogue has a lot of (very nice) preset designs which will allow members to get started immediately, and I found the ability to create text and shapes directly on the glowforge app very helpful in reducing the barrier to entry. Most advanced users will likely still stick to custom vector designs, however I think the focus should be on making the equipment as accessible as possible and requiring members to get to grips with inkscape/illustrator as well as the glowforge itself adds a hefty additional hurdle to getting started.</p>
<p><strong>Power</strong></p>
<p>This was discussed at length on slack at the start of the year, but there seem to be issues with power quality in unit 1. I’ve noticed the lights in the workshop flickering often although I’m not sure if there was ever a conclusion.</p>
<p><strong>Immediate Changes</strong></p>
<p>As mentioned previously, I’ve made a start on tidying and organising the workshop to make it easier to work in in the short term. One improvement I’d like to make probably this week is wall-mounting one of the whiteboards sitting beside the boiler room. Any input on where it should go would be much appreciated. I know getting the vacuum cleaner from under the stairs isn’t a huge task, but I’d also propose moving it’s home to the boiler room to make it more accessible given the workshop will need hoovered more than the rest of the space. Also, whilst everyone should be aware of the induction process at this point, it wouldn’t do any harm to add a sign to the workshop door stating that members must be inducted to use the workshop.</p>
<p>As mentioned on slack, I’ve hooked up one of the unused optiplex machines (the former VPS machine) on the electronics bench with a Ubuntu Live USB - if there are no other plans for it, I’d suggest making it another windows machine (with inkscape etc pre-installed) similar to the 3D printer PC to allow members to work with the glowforge without a laptop.</p>
<p><strong>TL;DR</strong></p>
<p>This has been a fucked-up year at Farset so we haven’t had time to properly organise the workshop and it’s contents. Something of this scale won’t work by just going in and moving shit, so discussing and planning ahead of time is essential, and given social distancing requirements, this will have to be as asynchronous as possible. After all this is done, the workshop should be an accessible space where anyone can easily find equipment and parts, and have access to tools with minimised barrier to entry. Farset is by the members for the members, so please have a say in how the space can work better for you.</p> ]]></description>

        <title>Virtual Event: InfoSecNI Watch-Along Movie Night - “Johnny Mnemonic” @ 7pm 22nd July!</title>
        <dc:creator><![CDATA[@bolster Andrew Bolster]]></dc:creator>
        <description><![CDATA[ <p>Based on William Gibson’s short story first published in 1981, the 1995 film by Robert Longo, follows the titular Johnny, a cybernetic data-courier, who is used to discreetly shuttle information in the real world that’s too sensitive for the VR based Internet of 2021. Seeking to regain his broken memories, Johnny undertakes ‘one more job’ to cover the costs of removal. After a risky procedure to give him more storage space, the clock is ticking for Johnny to get the data out of his head before the data in his brain kills him. The narrative incorporates themes that explore balance between superior technology against superior humanity. And Guns. Well, one gun.</p>
<p>And we’ll be watching it, this time a little later in the month.</p>
<p>As usual, this event will be a watch-along , so we’ll not be providing the media, but we’d encourage you to obtain it via rental and share the links in the discourse or otherwise and join in the discussion as we watch on Twitter using the <span class="hashtag">#InfoSecNI</span> hashtag or on our Discord, where we might even do a voice chat if we can deal with the sync issues…</p>

        <description><![CDATA[ <p><strong>6th meeting, 27 July 2020</strong><br>
(Andrew, Angie, Claire, Seamus, Tristan)</p>
<p>Debrief of last week’s Study Group event for Sec+. Very happy with progress but work is cut out for us to get it all done in the time. Will re-assess content and pacing after the first Deep Dive event.</p>
<p>Movie Nights still important - next one is anime Ghost in the Shell on 8th Aug - <strong>Andrew</strong> will handle main tweets, <strong>Angie</strong> to help.</p>
<p>Code of Conduct and extra mods agreed to be needed for Discord - <strong>Claire</strong> to handle<br>
Line to be added about us not being able to help you hack your mates, etc…</p>
<p>Twitter and Discord links to be added to the website - <strong>Andrew</strong></p>
<p>Forensics Hack idea seems good, but could be unexpectedly dodgy. <strong>Tristan</strong> suggested using a communal image from a repo might help. Date to be set once we find someone a bit more experienced to come along, and when suits them.</p>
<p>The calendar is getting a little complicated. Sticking with ical for now until we investigate/try other options to see what works - <strong>Andrew</strong> to continue handling ical.</p>
<p>ELI5 Farset events are restarting and may be of community interest to contribute something. Everyone to spread word if possible.</p> ]]></description>

<p>I’ve been creating internet accounts since I was in early teens and some of them are still “active”.</p>
<p>Time to time I remember them and think about that password I reused a bunch of times in 2010 and never changed.</p>
<p>A chance to take some time and think about security of your online accounts and learn ways to protect yourself.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[ <p>It’s one of the “recommended to start with” certifications as far as I’m seeing. An acquaintance of mine tried to go for OSCP as a first and also recommended that it’s better to start with CEH which they pivoted to.</p>
<p>I personally found that the OWASP materials were best for getting started in a professional context, rather than any certifications.</p> ]]></description>

        <dc:creator><![CDATA[@Angie Angie]]></dc:creator>
        <description><![CDATA[ <p>This went really super well this evening! Thanks so much to everyone who showed up and contributed so much, to both the discussion and the chatty atmosphere.</p>
<p>So a few things have come out of the event which are as follows:</p>
<p>The group will meet twice a week;</p>
<ul>
<li>on Monday evenings for a Deep Dive into that weeks chapter (hosted by a different community member each week), and then</li>
<li>a Quiz Night on Wednesday evenings where we go through questions about the Deep Dive chapter, as well as some generic Sec+ ones.</li>
</ul>
<p>Anyone is welcome to drop in and out of either session on any week, you don’t have to come to them all. Keep an eye out for our adverts here/Discord/Twitter for times and topics.</p>
<p>There is a sign-up sheet linked in the Study-Group-Chat on Discord if you are able to help host/present a topic area to the group. <a class="mention" href="https://discourse.farsetlabs.org.uk/u/claireb">@ClaireB</a> is amazing and talented, but we want to share the burden around a bit and establish a community.</p>
<p>Finally, we chatted about forensics for one of the questions, and there was some interest in having a hacking afternoon/evening where we all just show up together with drives to image/data to recover and work on it at the same time and show/chat about what we’re doing. I have put it on the Agenda for the next Steering Group meeting so we can get something in the calendar.</p> ]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA[ <p>I recently completed/attained the OSCP and found the whole course very informative.</p>
<p>I had spent about a year prepping for this, through other methods like hackthebox &amp; tryhackme etc before I signed up.</p>
<p>I received a notification that OffSec have recently updated their OSWE syllabus so I am tempted for that next. I need to get my Azure Admin cert out of the way first.</p>
<p>What’s the appeal of CEH for the users here?</p> ]]></description>

<p>I’m so sorry, I’m only seeing this now! That’d be great if you guys want to be involved! IT would be really useful to see which certs your members have found useful and take that as a basis for which certs we focus on. Thank you so much <img src="https://discourse.farsetlabs.org.uk/images/emoji/apple/grin.png?v=9" title=":grin:" class="emoji" alt=":grin:"> - we’d love to collaborate! Also, if any of your team wants to help me run any of the study groups, I’d be happy to have you! I’m starting with Sec+ because I’m studying for it, but I’m not as familiar with some of the other certs we’re likely to cover!</p> ]]></description>

        <dc:creator><![CDATA[@ClaireB Claire Burn]]></dc:creator>
        <description><![CDATA[ <p>Hello everyone! We’re going to be testing the waters and seeing if there’s interest out there for Security Certification Study Groups, and we’ll be pioneering this with a study group dedicated to the first few chapters of the CompTIA Security+ study guide on <em>Wednesday 22nd July at 6:30pm to 8pm (ish)</em>. We’ll be going through the chapters together and talking through difficult points, and doing the quizzes in the first 3 chapters of the book.</p>
<p><em>The study group will be held on our <a href="https://discord.gg/b8c3E9C" rel="nofollow noopener">Discord</a> server, make sure to join!</em></p>
<p>Don’t worry if you don’t have the study guide; come along anyway if you’re interested in this cert - the more the merrier!</p>
<p>We’ll be running additional study groups for other certs going forward too! Make sure to vote in the poll on our <a href="https://discord.gg/b8c3E9C" rel="nofollow noopener">Discord</a>, and make sure to vote here for the next study groups: <a href="https://discourse.farsetlabs.org.uk/t/which-security-certs-are-people-interested-in-taking/74" class="inline-onebox">Which Security Certs Are People Interested In Taking?</a></p>
<p>Make sure to register your interest here if you’ll be attending! :</p>
<p>Will you be attending the Sec+ Study Group?</p>
